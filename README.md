WideContacts
============
(Not finished)
Address book for iPhone (with Hope position on map and custom date picker).

Application with functionality of native iOS Address book.
+ positioning home point on map;
+ custom date picker;

-How it works-

At first launch app grab all contacts from native address book.
After that app will never synchronize with native address book.

Then you can add, delete or edit your own contact.
Array with contacts everytime saves to plist after contact saved or edit.
